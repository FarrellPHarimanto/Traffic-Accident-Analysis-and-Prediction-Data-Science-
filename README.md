# Traffic-Accident-Analysis-and-Prediction-Data-Science-
This data science project uses a dataset containing information on vehicles, drivers, road conditions, and weather. We will use supervised learning methods such as logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and SVM. The results from these methods will be compared to get the most accurate results.
