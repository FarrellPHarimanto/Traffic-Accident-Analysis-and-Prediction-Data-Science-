# Traffic-Accident-Analysis-and-Prediction-Data-Science-
This data science project uses a dataset containing information on vehicles, drivers, road conditions, and weather. We will use supervised learning methods such as logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and SVM. The results from these methods will be compared to get the most accurate results.

Based on several paper references and studies, we are working on this data science project using a dataset that contains information on vehicles, drivers, road conditions, and weather. Considering from reference paper that we have read, we do not use machine learning algorithms such as deep learning and neural networks which use heavy computational processing, instead, we will use supervised learning methods ranging from simple to complex ones such as logistic regression, random forests, decision trees, and SVC. The results from these methods will be compared to get the most accurate results.

Objectives:
1. To find out the accuracy of Machine Learning predictions regarding traffic accidents.
2. Evaluation of the process of classifying data on the causes of traffic accidents on data collection that affects prediction results and their solutions.
3. Comparing the results of machine learning predictions with data testing from training.

Methodology:
We will analyze the causes of accidents and predict the severity of accidents using various Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques. There will be steps such as Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization,  Data Manipulation, and Data Selection. For the prediction, the data will be divided into training and testing with 80% and 20% respectively. The Machine Learning algorithm and Data Mining Techniques that will be used in this paper are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest. The accuracy score of each algorithm and technique as well as the MAE, MAPE, and RMSE will be shown.
